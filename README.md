Super Micro fan control for Linux (home) servers.

## TL;DR

This is a `systemd service` running on Linux and can control fans with help of IPMI on Super Micro X10-X13/H10-H13 (and some X9) motherboards.

You can also run `smfc` in docker, see more details in [Docker.md](docker/Docker.md).

## Details
### 1. How does it work?
This service was designed for Super Micro motherboards having IPMI functionality, implementing fan controllers controlling
fan speed dynamically in one or more IPMI zones. The service operates the fans in IPMI FULL mode, where the fan rotation level
can be adjusted with IPMI raw commands (read [more details here](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?resources/supermicro-x9-x10-x11-fan-speed-control.20/)).

#### 1.1 IPMI zones
_IPMI zone_ is a logical term, representing a cooling zone, where there are predefined fans having the same rotation speed.
Please note that the fan assignment to an IPMI zone is predefined on the motherboard, it cannot be changed (Super Micro does not 
provide individual fan configuration features in IPMI, while other vendors do it). On a typical Super Micro motherboard, there are two IPMI zones:

- CPU or System zone (IPMI zone 0) with fan names: FAN1, FAN2, etc.
- Peripheral or HD zone (IPMI zone 1) with fan names: FANA, FANB, etc.

On Super Micro server boards, there could be more IPMI zones with different fan names (see [issue #31](https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/issues/31)). 

> `smfc v3.8.0` and earlier versions implemented a feature (called _Swapped Zones_) to swap IPMI zone 0 and 1. From `smfc v4.0.0` the IPMI zones can be assigned freely to fan controllers providing more freedom and convenience for the user (see `ipmi_zone=` parameter for more details).  

#### 1.2 Fan controllers
In `smfc`, the following fan controllers are implemented:


| Fan controller | Temperature source      | Configuration                                                           | Default IPMI zone   |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| CPU zone       | Intel/AMD CPU(s)        | CPUs are identified automatically                                       | 0 (CPU zone)        |
| HD zone        | SATA and SCSI HDDs/SSDs | Hard disks' names must be specified in `[HD zone] hd_names=` parameter  | 1 (Peripheral zone) | 
| GPU zone       | Nvidia GPUs             | GPU indices must be specified in `[GPU zone] gpu_device_ids=` parameter | 1 (Peripheral zone) |
| Constant zone  | None                    | Constant fan level can be specified in `[CONST zone] level=` parameter  | 1 (Peripheral zone) |

These fan controllers can be enabled and disabled independently. They can be used in a free combination with one or more IPMI zones. Overlapping is allowed (i.e. HD Zone and GPU Zone can both control `IPMI Zone 1`) - the maximum fan level from one of the controlling zones will be used.
_Constant zone_ is an exception here, it does not require a temperature source, it can provide a constant fan level for one or more IPMI zones, and cannot overlap.
In `smfc` configuration file each fan controller has an individual section.

In `smfc`, a temperature-driven fan controller implements the following control logic:

 1. it reads the zone's temperature
 2. it calculates a new fan level based on the user-defined control function and the temperature value of the zone 
 3. it configures the new fan level for the zone(s) with IPMI commands (i.e. `ipmitool`)

<img src="https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/raw/main/doc/smfc_overview.png" align="center" width="600">

If there are multiple heat sources (e.g. multiple CPUs, HDDs or GPUs) defined in the fan controller, then the user can configure a calculation method (i.e. minimum, average, maximum) for the temperature calculation (see `temp_calc=` parameter in the configuration).

Please note that `smfc` will set all fans back to 100% speed at service termination to avoid overheating! 

#### 2. User-defined control function
Fan controllers are using user-defined control functions where a temperature interval is being mapped to a fan rotation level interval.

 <img src="https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/raw/main/doc/userdefined_control_function.png" align="center" width="500">

The following five parameters will define such a function:

     min_temp=
     max_temp=
     min_level=
     max_level=
     steps=

In this way, a fan controller can map any new temperature value to a fan level (from Celsius degrees to % value).   
Changing the fan rotational speed is a very slow process (it could take several seconds depending on the fan type and the requested amount of change), so we try to minimize these kinds of actions. Instead of setting fan rotational speed continuously, we define discrete fan levels based on `steps=` parameter.

 <img src="https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/raw/main/doc/fan_output_levels.png" align="center" width="500">

The fan controllers implement the following strategies to avoid/minimize the unnecessary change of fan rotation speed:

 1. When the fan rotational speed is changed, it always applies a delay time (defined in `[IPMI] fan_level_delay=` configuration parameter) to let the fan implement the physical change.
 2. There is a sensitivity threshold parameter (`sensitivity=`) in the fan controller configuration. While the temperature change is below this value, the fan controller does not react. 
 3. The configuration parameter `polling=` defines the frequency of the temperature reading. The bigger polling time, the lower frequency of the fan speed change.

#### 3. Standby guard
For HD zone fan controller, an additional optional feature was implemented, called *Standby guard*, with the following assumptions:
	
 - SATA hard disks are organized into a RAID array
 - the RAID array will go to standby mode recurrently

This feature is monitoring the power state of SATA hard disks (with the help of the `smartctl`) and will put the whole array to standby mode if a few members are already stepped into that. With this feature, the situation can be avoided where the array is partially in standby mode while other members are still active.
SCSI disks are not compatible with this feature.

#### 5. Hard disk compatibility
The `smfc` service was originally designed for `SATA` hard drives, but `smfc v3.0.0` is also compatible with `NVME` and `SAS/SCSI` disks. The following table summarizes how the temperature is read for different disk types: 

| Disk type  | Temperature source   | Kernel module | Command    |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|------------|
| `SATA`     | Linux kernel (HWMON) | `drivetemp`   | -          |
| `NVME`     | Linux kernel (HWMON) | -             | -          |
| `SAS/SCSI` | `smartctl`           | -             | `smartctl` |

Some additional notes:

- For `NVME` SSDs no kernel driver needs to be loaded the kernel can handle this disk type automatically
- For `SATA` disks the `drivetemp` kernel module should be loaded. **This is the fastest way to read disk temperature**, and the kernel module can report the temperature while hard disks are in sleep mode!
- For `SAS/SCSI` disks the `smartctl` command will be used to read disk temperature
- If `drivetemp` module is not loaded or an HDD is not compatible with `drivetemp` module then `smfc` will use `smartctl` automatically.   
- Different disks types can be mixed in `hd_names=` configuration parameter but the *Standby guard* feature will not be supported in this case.
- It is NOT RECOMMENDED to mix NVME SSD and SATA/SCSI disks in `hd_names=` parameter, because they are operating in quite different temperature intervals (e.g. 30-40C vs 40-80C).


### 5. Super Micro compatibility
This software was designed to work with Super Micro X10-X12/H10-H12 motherboards with a BMC chip (i.e. ASPEED AST2400/2500) and with IPMI functionality. Unfortunately, there are some motherboards (e.g. X10QBi see [issue #69](https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/issues/69)) not compatible with `smfc`.

In case of X9 motherboards the compatibility is not guaranteed, it depends on the hardware components of the motherboard (i.e. not all X9 motherboards employ a BMC chip). 

The earlier X8 motherboards are NOT compatible with this software. They do not implement `IPMI FULL` mode, and they cannot control fan levels with IPMI raw commands.

The newer X13/H13 motherboards (with AST2600 chips) are compatible with `smfc` (see mode details in [issue #33](https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/issues/33) about an X13SAE-F motherboard). The only difference is in the implementation of thresholds, AST2600 chip implements only `Lower Critical` threshold, so setting up thresholds is different.  

Feel free to create a short feedback in [discussion #55](https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/discussions/55) on your compatibility experience.


### 6. IPMI fan control and sensor thresholds
On Super Micro X10-X11 motherboards IPMI uses six sensor thresholds to specify the safe and unsafe fan rotational speed intervals (these are RPM values rounded to nearest hundreds, defined for each fan separately):

```
Lower Non-Recoverable  
Lower Critical  
Lower Non-Critical
Upper Non-Critical  
Upper Critical  
Upper Non-Recoverable
```

but newer Super Micro X13 motherboards (with AST2600 BMC chip) have only one sensor threshold:

```
Lower Critical  
```

Originally, this chapter was created Super Micro X10-X11 motherboards, but can be easily adopted to X13 motherboards as well (see more details in #33).

Like many other utilities (created by NAS and home server community), `smfc` also uses **IPMI FULL mode** for fan control, where all fans in the zone:

   1. initially configured to full speed (100%)
   2. then their speed can be safely configured in `[Lower Critical, Upper Critical]` interval
   3. if any fan speed oversteps either `Lower Critical` or `Upper Critical` threshold then IPMI will generate an _assertion event_ and will set the all fan speeds back to 100% in the zone

Please also consider the fact that **fans are mechanical devices, their rotational speed is not stable** (it could be fluctuating). To avoid IPMI's assertion mechanism described here please follow the next steps: 

  1. Per fan: check the minimum and maximum rotational speeds of your fan on its vendor website
  2. Per fan: configure proper IMPI sensor thresholds adjusted to the fan speed interval
  3. Per zone: define safe `min_level`/`max_level` values for `smfc` respecting the variance of the all fans in the IPMI zone (it could take several iterations and adjustments) 

<img src="https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/raw/main/doc/ipmi_sensor_threshold.png" align="center" width="600">

Here is a real-life example for a [Noctua NF-F12 PWM](https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-f12-pwm) fan:

```
Upper Non-Recoverable = 1800 rpm
Upper Critical = 1700 rpm
Upper Non-Critical = 1600 rpm
Lower Non-Critical = 200 rpm
Lower Critical = 100 rpm
Lower Non-Recoverable = 0 rpm
Max RPM = 1500 rpm
Min PRM = 300 rpm
max_level = 100 (i.e. 1500 rpm)
min_level = 35 (i.e. 500 rpm)
```


Notes:
  - Use the following `ipmitool` command to display the current IMPI sensor thresholds for fans:
    ```
    root@home:~# ipmitool sensor|grep FAN
    FAN1             | 500.000    | RPM        | ok    | 0.000     | 100.000   | 200.000   | 1600.000  | 1700.000  | 1800.000  
    FAN2             | 500.000    | RPM        | ok    | 0.000     | 100.000   | 200.000   | 1600.000  | 1700.000  | 1800.000  
    FAN3             | na         |            | na    | na        | na        | na        | na        | na        | na        
    FAN4             | 400.000    | RPM        | ok    | 0.000     | 100.000   | 200.000   | 1600.000  | 1700.000  | 1800.000  
    FANA             | 500.000    | RPM        | ok    | 0.000     | 100.000   | 200.000   | 1600.000  | 1700.000  | 1800.000  
    FANB             | 500.000    | RPM        | ok    | 0.000     | 100.000   | 200.000   | 1600.000  | 1700.000  | 1800.000  
    ```
  - Use the following `ipmitool` command to list assertion events:
    ```
    root@home:~# ipmitool sel list
       1 | 10/19/2023 | 05:15:35 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Critical going low  | Asserted
       2 | 10/19/2023 | 05:15:35 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Non-recoverable going low  | Asserted
       3 | 10/19/2023 | 05:15:38 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Non-recoverable going low  | Deasserted
       4 | 10/19/2023 | 05:15:38 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Critical going low  | Deasserted
       5 | 10/19/2023 | 05:20:59 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Critical going low  | Asserted
    ```
  - Use the following `ipmitool` commands to specify all six sensor thresholds for FAN1:
    ```
    root@home:~# ipmitool sensor thresh FAN1 lower 0 100 200
    root@home:~# ipmitool sensor thresh FAN1 upper 1600 1700 1800
    ```
  - You can also edit and run `ipmi/set_ipmi_treshold.sh` to configure all IPMI sensor thresholds
  - If you install new BMC firmware on your Super Micro motherboard, you have to configure IPMI thresholds again
  - If you do not see fans when executing `ipmitool sensors`, you may want to reset the BMC to factory default using the Web UI or using `ipmitool mc reset cold`
  - Noctua specifies the variance of minimum and maximum fan rotational speeds (e.g. see the [specification of Noctua NF-F12 PWM](https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-f12-pwm/specification)). For example:

    - `Rotational speed (+/- 10%) 1500 RPM`: 1350-1650 RPM interval
    - `Min. rotational speed @ 20% PWM (+/-20%) 300 RPM`: 240-360 RPM interval
    
    Please note that [LNA](https://noctua.at/en/na-src10)/ULNA cables or [Y-cables](https://noctua.at/en/na-syc1) can modify the rotational speed calculations here and the required IPMI sensor thresholds too. 

You can read more about:

### 7. Power management
If low noise and low heat generation are important attributes of your Linux box, then you may consider the following chapters.

#### 7.1 CPU
Most of the modern CPUs has multiple energy saving features. You can check your BIOS and enable them to minimize the heat generation.

Intel(R) CPUs:
 - Intel(R) Speed Shift Technology
 - Intel(R) SpeedStep
 - C-states
 - Boot performance mode

AMD(R) CPUs:
 - PowerNow!
 - Cool\`n\`quiet
 - Turbo Core

With this setup the CPU will change its base frequency and power consumption dynamically based on the load.

#### 7.2 SATA hard disks
In case of SATA hard disks, you may enable:

 - advanced power management
 - spin down timer

With the help of command `hdparm` you can enable advanced power management and specify a spin down timer (read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdparm)):

	hdparm -B 127 /dev/sda
	hdparm -S 240 /dev/sda
	
In file `/etc/hdparm.conf` you can specify all parameters persistently:

	quiet

	/dev/sda {
        apm = 127
        spindown_time = 240
	}
	/dev/sdb {
        apm = 127
        spindown_time = 240
	}
	...

Important notes: 
 1. If you plan to spin down your hard disks or RAID array (i.e. put them to standby mode) you have to set up the configuration parameter `[HD zone] polling=` minimum twice bigger as the `spindown_time` specified here.
 2. In file `/etc/hdparm.conf` you must define HD names in `/dev/disk/by-id/...` form to avoid inconsistency.

### 8. Kernel modules
We need to load the following important Linux kernel modules:

 - [`coretemp`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/hwmon/coretemp.html): temperature report for Intel(R) CPUs
 - [`k10temp`](https://docs.kernel.org/hwmon/k10temp.html): temperature report for AMD(R) CPUs
 - [`drivetemp`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/hwmon/drivetemp.html): temperature report for SATA hard disks (available from kernel 5.6+ version)

Use `/etc/modules` file for persistent loading of these modules. 
Here are some sample HWMON file locations for these kernel modules:

 - `coretemp`: `/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input`
 - `k10temp`: `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/k10temp/0000*/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input`
 - `drivetemp`: `/sys/class/scsi_disk/0:0:0:0/device/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input`

Notes:
- `smfc` is able to find the proper HWMON file automatically for Intel(R) CPUs, AMD(R) CPUs, SATA drives, or NVMe drives, but users may also specify the files manually (see `hwmon_path=` parameter in the config file)
- Reading `drivetemp` module is the fastest way to get the temperature of the hard disks, and it can read temperature of the SATA hard disks even in standby mode, too. 

#### 9. Installation and uninstallation
For the installation and uninstallation, you need root privilege. There are several ways to install and `smfc`, this chapter will show them.

#### 9.1. Manual installation and uninstallation
There is an installation script ([`bin/install.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petersulyok/smfc/refs/heads/main/bin/install.sh)) which can install `smfc` in two different ways:
- remotely from the GitHub repository (no cloning required)
- locally from a git repository (GitHub repository needs to be cloned)

The installation script requires `curl`, `pip`, `gzip`, and `mandb` commands, and it has the following
command line parameters:

```
user@host:~$ ./install.sh --help
usage: install.sh [-h|--help] [-k|--keep-config] [-l|--local] [-v|--verbose]
           -h, --help         help text
           -k, --keep-config  keep original configuration file
           -l, --local        installation from a local git repository
           -v, --verbose      verbose output
```

The default location of the installed files: 

| Files          | Installation folder                                        | Description                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `smfc.service` | `/etc/systemd/system`                                      | systemd service definition file |
| `smfc`         | `/etc/default`                                             | service command line options    |
| `smfc.conf`    | `/etc/smfc`                                                | service configuration file      |
| `smfc.1.gz`    | `/usr/local/share/man/man1`                                | smfc manual page                | 
| `smfc`         | `/usr/local/bin` or </br> `/usr/bin`                       | smfc command                    |
| `smfc service` | `/usr/local/lib/python3.xx` or </br> `/usr/lib/python3.xx` | smfc python package             |

Notes for the script:
- Different Linux distros install python package to different folders
- The installation script was tested on Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13, Suse Leap 15, Proxmox 9, and Arch Linux
- Installation process will stop for any error
- The default installation method is the remote installation
- Using `--local` parameter will do installation locally, from the current folder (the GitHUb repository needs to be cloned)
- In default, a new configuration file will be installed (an existing previous configuration file will be renamed) and
the `hd_names=` parameter will be pre-filled with the list of existing hard disks for user's convenience (please check/edit this paramaeter!)
- Using `--keep-config` parameter, the original configuration file will be preserved
- Using `--verbose` parameter, the phases of the installation will be displayed 

For remote installation the script can be executed (as root user) this way:

```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petersulyok/smfc/refs/heads/main/bin/install.sh|bash /dev/stdin --verbose
```

or if you want to preserve your existing configuration file:

```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petersulyok/smfc/refs/heads/main/bin/install.sh|bash /dev/stdin --verbose --keep-config
```

For local installation follow these steps (here [`uv` command](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is also required):

```
git clone https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc.git
cd smfc
uv sync
uv build
./bin/install.sh --local --verbose --keep-config
```

(here we clone the GitHub repository and make the `smfc` package locally before installation).

On the other hand, there is an uninstallation script ([`bin/uninstall.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petersulyok/smfc/refs/heads/main/bin/uninstall.sh)) which can uninstall `smfc`.
This script has the following command line parameters:

```
user@host:~$ ./uninstall.sh --help
usage: uninstall.sh [-h|--help] [-k|--keep-config] [-v|--verbose]
           -h, --help         help text
           -k, --keep-config  keep original configuration file
           -v, --verbose      verbose output
```

This script can be executed locally and remotely as it described for installation here. Here is an axample for remote execution: 

```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petersulyok/smfc/refs/heads/main/bin/uninstall.sh|bash /dev/stdin --verbose
```

The script will remove the installed `smfc` files and the pyton package.

#### 9.2. Docker installation
`smfc` is also available as a docker image, see more details in [Docker.md](../docker/Docker.md). In this case, your job is only to provide your configuration file on host computer, `smfc` will be executed automatically when the container is starting. 

### 10. Configuration file
After successful installation, create/edit your new configuration file. If you just upgraded to a new `smfc` version, you can preserve the existing one. 

#### 10.1 Right strategy to create your configuration file
You have to think over and answer the following questions:

1. What are the most important heat sources in your machine? Typically, these could be CPU(s), hard disks, or GPUs.
2. Which fan controller would you like to use and configure in `smfc`?
3. What is the expected temperature interval (minimum/maximum C degree) for the selected temperature source(s)? Use some test tools to measure it (e.g. [`s-tui`](https://github.com/amanusk/s-tui), [`fio`](https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html), [`iozone`](https://www.iozone.org/)) if you don't have their track records.  
4. Which IPMI zone(s) will be connected to these fan controllers/temperate sources)? Check how many IPMI zones you have, how the fans are connected on your motherboard, and how they are cooling the selected temperature source(s). 
5. What is the stable level interval for fans in the selected IPMI zone(s)? Probably this part requires the most patience! You have assumptions here, you will try them. If there are IPMI assertions and your fans are spinning up then you will refine the interval and try again. You might have several cycles here, this is normal.

Important notes:
1. `[IPMI zone] remote_parameters=-U USERNAME -P PASSWORD -H HOST` parameter can be used for remote access for the IPMI interface. It could be useful for a VM setup where the hard disks are configured with PCI passthrough (e.g. a TrueNAS running in a VM on Proxmox), but IPMI needs to be accessed "remotely". Please note that the HOST is the BMC network address (not the VM host address). 
2. `[HD zone] hd_names=` is a compulsory parameter for this fan controller, and it must be specified in `/dev/disk/by-id/...` form. Please note that the `/dev/sda` form is not persistent could be changed after a reboot!
3. `[CPU zone] / [HD zone] min_level= / max_level=` should be configured in alignment with threshold configuration (see more in [this chapter](https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/blob/main/README.md#6-ipmi-fan-control-and-sensor-thresholds)). Be patient, several refinement cycles could happen.
4. Several sample configuration files are provided in `./config/samples` folder.
5. Save/backup your configuration file when you've got the final version. Avoid overwriting if you upgrade to a new version of `smfc`.


### 11. How to run `smfc`?
After a manual installation `smfc` can be started and stopped as a standard `systemd` service. Remember to reload `systemd` configuration after a new installation or if you changed the service definition file:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start smfc.service
systemctl stop smfc.service
systemctl restart smfc.service
systemctl status smfc.service
root@nas:~# systemctl status smfc
● smfc.service - Super Micro Fan Control
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/smfc.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2025-06-23 17:55:50 CEST; 6 days ago
   Main PID: 8464 (smfc)
      Tasks: 1 (limit: 76863)
     Memory: 10.4M
        CPU: 7min 35.345s
     CGroup: /system.slice/smfc.service
             └─8464 /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/smfc -c /etc/smfc/smfc.conf -l 3

Jun 29 19:17:29 nas smfc.service[8464]: CPU zone: new fan level > 48%/34.0C @ IPMI [0] zone(s).
Jun 29 19:21:07 nas smfc.service[8464]: CPU zone: new fan level > 61%/38.0C @ IPMI [0] zone(s).
Jun 29 19:21:11 nas smfc.service[8464]: CPU zone: new fan level > 48%/34.0C @ IPMI [0] zone(s).
```

The `smfc` program has the following parameters:

```
root@nas$ smfc --help
usage: smfc [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-v] [-l {0,1,2,3,4}] [-o {0,1,2}] [-nd] [-s] [-ne]

options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE  configuration file (default is /etc/smfc/smfc.conf)
  -v, --version   show program's version number and exit
  -l {0,1,2,3,4}  set log level: 0-NONE, 1-ERROR(default), 2-CONFIG, 3-INFO, 4-DEBUG
  -o {0,1,2}      set log output: 0-stdout, 1-stderr, 2-syslog(default)
  -nd             no dependency checking at start
  -s              use sudo command
  -ne             no fan speed recovery at exit
```

`smfc` command-line options can be specified in `/etc/default/smfc` file if you run `smfc` as a systemd service. 

If you are testing your configuration, you can start `smfc.py` directly in a terminal (logging to the standard output on debug log level):

	smfc -o 0 -l 3

In case of Docker installation, `smfc` will be executed automatically when the container is started. Its command-line parameters can be specified in the docker-compose file. 

### 12. Checking the results and monitoring the logs
All messages will be logged to the specific output and the specific level.
With the help of command `journalctl` you can check logs easily. For example:

1. listing service logs of the last two hours:

		journalctl -u smfc --since "2 hours ago"

2. listing service logs from the last boot:

		journalctl -b -u smfc

## 13. FAQ

### Q: My fans are spinning up and loud. What's wrong?
Most probably, there was an assertion (i.e the rotational speed of a fan went above or below of a IPMI threshold) and IPMI switched back that zone to full rotational speed.
You can check the current fan rotational speeds:

	ipmitool sdr

and you can also check IPMI event log and list assertion events:

```
root@home:~# ipmitool sel list
   1 | 10/19/2023 | 05:15:35 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Critical going low  | Asserted
   2 | 10/19/2023 | 05:15:35 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Non-recoverable going low  | Asserted
   3 | 10/19/2023 | 05:15:38 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Non-recoverable going low  | Deasserted
   4 | 10/19/2023 | 05:15:38 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Critical going low  | Deasserted
   5 | 10/19/2023 | 05:20:59 PM CEST | Fan #0x46 | Lower Critical going low  | Asserted
```

If the problematic fan (causing the alert) is identified, then you must adjust its threshold. This process could take several adjustment cycle. Be patent :)
