## [v4.0.0] - 2025-07-08 Final Release 
The final release is identical with the beta-14 version and some documentation updates. Here is a high level summary of new features and changes:

### New
- `smfc` is using `udev` (`pyudev` package) for device management (thanks to @abbaad): 
  - Automatic discovery of HWMON files for both Intel and AMD CPUs, including the number of CPUs, no manual configuration required. 
  - Automatic discovery of HWMON files for HDDs/SSDs based on `hd_names=` parameter, including the number of HDDS/SSDs, no manual configuration required.
  - Automatic use of `smartctl` if no HWMON file found for a hard disks (e.g. SCSI disk).
- `smfc` is a Python package, uploaded to pypi.org
- `smfc` has new command-line options (-s, -nd, -ne)
- `smfc` is using `uv` for Python project management
- `smfc` implements new fan controllers:
  - `[GPU zone]`: supporting nvidia GPUs (using `nvidia-smi` command)
  - `[CONST zone]` constant fan level in the zone(s)
- `smfc` implements free IPMI zone assignment, where a fan controller can control fans on one or more IPMI zones (see `ipmi_zone= parameter`)
- `CHANGELOG.md` added

### Change
- `smfc` installer moved to `bin` folder, and can install remotely:

    `curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petersulyok/smfc/refs/heads/main/bin/install.sh|bash /dev/stdin --keep-config --verbose`

- Default location of `smfc.conf ` moved to `/etc/smfc` folder.
- `hddtemp` is deprecated, `smfc` uses `smartctl` command for SAS/SCSI disks.
- `smfc` configuration file changes: 
  - `smfc` can read the old configuration files (version 3.x), but some parameters are not used anymore.
  - `count=` parameter is not used anymore, count is calculated automatically.
  - `hwmon_path=` parameter is not used anymore, identified automatically.
  - `hddtemp_path`= is not used anymore.
  - `swapped_zones=` is not used anymore, use `ipmi_zone=` parameter instead to specify the proper IPMI zone
- `TESTING.md` was renamed to `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Docker changes:
  - There are two docker images available: smaller standard image (Alpine Linux based), bigger gpu-enabled image (Debian 12 based)
  - Tag naming is also changed (e.g. 4.0, latest, 4.0-gpu, latest-gpu)

### Removed
- Unused test data files from `test` folder 
- Unused scripts from `bin` folder 
- `hddtemp` removed

### Fix
- Support of AMD CPUs (without manual configuration) - issue #25


## [v4.0.0b14] - 2025-06-22 Pre-release 

### Fix
- Fix: issue #76 corrected, where a parsing error blocked HdZone's initialization for newer SCSI disks.


## [v4.0.0b13] - 2025-06-06 Pre-release 

### Fix
- Fix: test_08_service.py stopped running if `nvidia-smi` was not installed.
- Fix: pylint warning


## [v4.0.0b12] - 2025-06-06 Pre-release 

### New
- GPU zone fan controller is enabled in docker (please read [Docker.md](https://github.com/petersulyok/smfc/blob/main/docker/Docker.md))
- There are two docker images available: standard, gpu-enabled
- Dependency check: check of `nvidia-smi` added


## [v4.0.0b11] - 2025-06-02 Pre-release 

### New
- Docker building script updated to BuildKit
- New docker image uploaded to docker hub (but GPU zone is still not working in docker)
- New package uploaded to pypi.org


## [v4.0.0b10] - 2025-05-23 Pre-release 

### New
- A new fan controller, called CONST zone, implemented to provide constant fan level in one or more IPMI zones. It does not have any temperature source
and does not read any temperature. The zone configuration is the following:

```
# Const zone: this fan controller does not read any temperature and sets constant fan level for IPMI zones(s).
[CONST zone]
# Fan controller enabled (bool, default=0)
enabled=0
# IPMI zone(s) (comma- or space-separated list of int, default=1))
ipmi_zone=1
# Polling interval for checking level and restting if needed (int, sec, default=30)
polling=30
# Constant fan level (int, %, default=50)
level=50
```

- Unit tests and smoketest updated
- Python package on `pypi.org` updated to v4.0.0b10
- Docker image IS NOT updated!


## [v4.0.0b9] - 2025-05-22 Pre-release 

### Fixed
- HdZone init fixed.
- Python package on `pypi.org` updated to v4.0.0b9
- Docker image IS NOT updated!


## [v4.0.0b8] - 2025-05-19 Pre-release 

### Fixed
- GPU fan controller feature fixed (missing commit added).
- Python package on `pypi.org` updated to v4.0.0b8
- Docker image IS NOT updated!


## [v4.0.0b7] - 2025-05-18 Pre-release 

### New/Added
- New GPU fan controller implemented for Nvidia video cards. A new section added to the configuration file.
- Python package on `pypi.org` updated to v4.0.0b7
- Docker image IS NOT updated!


## [v4.0.0b6] - 2025-05-06 Pre-release 

### New/Added
- Further enhancement of **_Free zone assignment_** feature: multiple IPMI zones can be assigned to a fan controller.
It means that `ipmi_zone=` parameter could be a (comma- or space-separated) list of integers. This configuration could
be useful for server chassis or motherboard where the fans are cooling everything and the proper heat source needs
to be selected for all fans. For example:

    ```
    [CPU zone]
    ...
    ipmi_zone = 0, 1
    ```
    in this configuration, the CPU temperature will control the fans in the IPMI zones 0 and 1, while here:

    ```
    [HD zone]
    ...
    ipmi_zone = 2, 3
    ```
    the HDD temperature will control the fans in the IPMI zones 2 and 3.

- IPMI zone information added to the new fan level log message, for example:

    `smfc.service[1645]: CPU zone: new fan level > 35%/28.0C @ IPMI [0, 1] zone(s).`

- Python package on `pypi.org` updated to v4.0.0b6
- Docker image updated to v4.0.0.b6


## [v4.0.0b5] - 2025-04-21 Pre-release 

### New/Added
- Free IPMI zone assignment feature implemented:
  - Any IPMI zone can be assigned to _CPU zone_ or _Hd Zone_, to support server motherboards having multiple IPMI zones,
and to implement the former _Swapped zones_ feature in a more generic way.
  - `ipmi_zone=` parameter added to zone configuration
  - Users of _Swapped zones_ feature, please adjust your configuration!
- New command line options added to `install.sh` (`-k`, `-v`)
- CHANGELOG.md document added

### Changed
- DEVELOPMENT.md document added (TESTING.md renamed/extended)

### Removed
- `swapped_zones=` parameter is not used anymore, this feature can be used with free IPMI zone assignment. 

### Fixed 
- `install.sh` cannot save the existing configuration file (discussion #64)

## [v4.0.0b4] - 2025-04-18
